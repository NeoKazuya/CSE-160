Notes to grader:

Primary shapes implemented are Cube, Sphere, and Pyramid.

Lights added were Hemisphere for the overall scene, then Ambient, Point, and Spot for the maze.

Point is above the maze, and Spot is on top of the fish. Helper visualizations are commented out but in the code.

Maze and outside wall collision detection have been added and instances of chatgpt use are noted in the code
